Here is the revised version:
Real-Time Stock Analysis and Prediction Platform (RTSP)

===========================================================
Project Overview

---------------
RTSP is a sophisticated web application designed to empower investors and financial enthusiasts with real-time stock information, predictive analytics, and sentiment-driven trend adjustments.
Project Objectives

------------------
Real-Time Data Monitoring: Provide live stock prices and updates for user-selected stocks.
Predictive Analytics: Utilize historical data and advanced forecasting models to predict short-term stock trends.
Sentiment Analysis: Incorporate real-time news sentiment analysis to enhance and refine predictive models.
Data Visualization: Present data through interactive and intuitive visualizations for effortless interpretation.
Security Enhancements: Implement robust security measures to protect against API abuse and ensure data integrity.
Key Features

--------------
1. Interactive Stock Selection

Dropdown and Search Functionality: Users can select stocks via a dropdown menu or by typing the stock symbol.
Accurate Symbol Retrieval: Stock symbols are fetched and cached from reliable sources (S&P 500 list from Wikipedia) using httpx.
2. Real-Time Data Visualization

Dynamic Plotly Graphs: Upon stock selection, the application displays live stock data using Plotly graphs.
Customizable Graph Types: Users can choose between various graph types (e.g., candlestick, line).
Adjustable Time Frames: Users can customize the time frame for data visualization (e.g., 1 day, 1 week, 1 month).
3. Historical Data Analysis

Comprehensive Data Retrieval: The application fetches and analyzes historical stock data using yfinance.
Trend and Pattern Identification: Utilizes historical data to identify trends, seasonality, and other patterns.
4. Predictive Analytics

Forecast Generation: A dedicated "Show Predictions" button triggers the display of a prediction chart.
Prophet Integration with CmdStanPy: Predictions are generated using Facebook's Prophet model with the cmdstanpy backend.
Visualization of Predictions: The prediction chart appears below the actual data chart for easy comparison.
5. Sentiment Analysis Integration

Real-Time News Fetching: The application retrieves recent news articles related to the selected stock using the NewsData.io API.
FinBERT Analysis: Sentiment analysis is performed on these articles using FinBERT via Hugging Face models.
Sentiment-Driven Insights: Sentiment scores are utilized to adjust or contextualize the predictions made by Prophet.
6. User-Friendly Interface

Intuitive Design: A clean and responsive design ensures seamless navigation and data interpretation.
Interactive Elements: Dropdown menus, search bars, and customizable options enhance user interaction and engagement.
7. Security Measures

Secure API Key Management: Utilizes environment variables managed by python-dotenv to securely store API keys.
Input Validation: Implements robust input validation mechanisms using Pydantic models.
Caching Mechanisms: Employs in-memory caching using cachetools.TTLCache to store frequently accessed data.
